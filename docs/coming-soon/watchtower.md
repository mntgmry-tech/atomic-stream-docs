# WatchTower (Coming Soon)

WatchTower is not live yet.

Planned scope:

- Automated monitoring over AtomicStream data
- Alert delivery to common channels
- Focus on actionable, filtered signals

When it launches, configuration and API details will be published here. For now, use x402 streams for live data access.
